Here the source code is given for the implementation of a Distributed Event Coordination System:

The server folder has server code and log file generated.
The client folder has the client code. 

Here makefile is used to compile the code.

To run the server,
type: make
type:./server -h -p (port number)  -l (log file name)
example:
./server -h -p 9091 -l sow.txt


To run the client,
type: make
type:./client -h -s (IP address) -p (port number) 
example:
./client -h -s 127.0.0.1 -p 9091
